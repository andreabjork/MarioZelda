Once upon a time, in the far away land of Binaria, there lived a statistically above average looking prince.
He was weary, for he was burdened with great responsibility following his parents untimely death at the hands
of the evil warlord, Memleek. To combat his own weariness he liked to indulge himself cryptographically secure
pseudorandom strolls through his castle gardens. But lo, as time went by his strolls devolved into a pattern which
allowed Memleek to commit his diabolical plan and abduct the prince from the very castle grounds. With the people of
Binaria left leaderless and in a state of great peril, they look to their hero to save the day; the princes bastard
half-sister, princess Avocado.
